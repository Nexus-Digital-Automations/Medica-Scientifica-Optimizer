It's a **moderately complex** application.

Think of it less like a simple website and more like building a small-scale turn-based strategy game. The individual calculations are simple (just arithmetic), but the complexity comes from the **interlocking systems and state management**. Every action on every simulated day has a cascading effect on all future days.

## Lines of Code (LOC) Estimate

This is a rough estimate, as it can vary greatly depending on the programming language, libraries, and coding style used.

### **Total Estimate: 900 - 1,500 lines of code**

Here’s a plausible breakdown:

* **Simulation Core (500 - 800 lines):**
    This is the largest and most critical part. It requires meticulous coding to ensure every rule of the factory—from production flow and WIP tracking to financial calculations—is modeled perfectly.

* **Genetic Algorithm Engine (250 - 400 lines):**
    This part is algorithmically complex but not necessarily long. It involves defining the strategy's "DNA," then writing the functions for population management, selection, breeding, and mutation.

* **User Interface & Glue Code (150 - 300 lines):**
    This includes the basic HTML/CSS for the display and the JavaScript to handle the "run" button, display progress, and format the final, readable strategy for the user.

The challenge isn't writing a vast amount of code; it's the precision required to make sure the simulation is a perfect mirror of the business case.

Yes, it absolutely should. Providing a full forecast is a key feature of the app.

While the main goal of the optimizer is to find the single best strategy, the app is already generating the day-by-day data for every variable to get to that result. The final step is to display that complete forecast for the winning strategy.

## How It Works

After the optimization engine finishes and presents the optimal action plan, there would be a "View Detailed Forecast" option. This would show you how the factory's key metrics are projected to evolve over the entire simulation if you follow the recommended plan.

This would include:
* **Graphs:** Visual line charts showing the day-by-day progression of:
    * Cash on Hand
    * Total Debt
    * Raw Material Inventory
    * WIP (Work-in-Process) for both lines



* **Data Table:** A detailed table with the daily values for users who want to inspect the numbers more closely.

## Why This Is Important

This forecast provides crucial context and builds confidence in the recommended strategy. You wouldn't just see the final destination (the maximum cash); you would see the entire journey.

For example, you could visually confirm:
* The initial dip in cash as you take a loan and buy inventory.
* The point where your cash flow turns positive.
* How quickly the WIP bottleneck gets resolved after hiring a rookie.
* The exact day your company is projected to become debt-free.

This adds a powerful layer of **transparency**, allowing you to understand *why* the optimal strategy is the best one.
