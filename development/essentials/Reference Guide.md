Yes, absolutely.

The guide I just provided contains all the **architectural and logical information** a developer needs. It explains *what* to build (a simulation core and a genetic algorithm optimizer) and *how* those components must work together to find the optimal strategy.

To make it a complete, self-contained package for them, you can simply combine that guide with the following **consolidated reference sheet** of all the specific numbers and starting conditions from the simulation.

This is everything they need.

### ## Developer's Reference Sheet: Constants & Initial Conditions

A developer can use this information to populate the variables and rules within the simulation core.

#### **Initial Conditions (Start of Day 51)**
* **Cash:** $8,206.12
* **Debt:** $70,000.00
* **Raw Material Inventory:** 0 units
* **Standard Line WIP:** 120 units
* **Standard Finished Goods:** 0 units
* **Custom Line WIP:** 295 orders
* **Workforce:** 1 Expert, 0 Rookies

#### **Ambiguities the Developer Must Model**

The case study intentionally leaves two key factors for the player to figure out. Your app will need to model these:

1.  **Machine Throughput:** The documents do not state a simple "X units per day" for each machine. The app must calculate this based on the process descriptions. The MCE is the shared pacemaker, and its total daily output is the primary constraint to model.
2.  **Custom Price Model:** The exact formula linking `AvgCustomDeliveryTime` to `CurrentCustomPrice` is not given. The blueprint provides a logical starting point (`Price = Base - (Penalty * (Time - Target))`), but the developer will need to implement this as a core part of the simulation's "rules of the world."
