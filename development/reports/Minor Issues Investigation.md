**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Investigator**: Claude (AI Assistant)
**CSV Analyzed**: `medica-scientifica-comprehensive-export (2).csv` (Generated: Oct 3, 2025 16:49)

## Executive Summary

Three minor issues were investigated from user-reported observations of simulation output. Investigation revealed:

1. **Workforce Counting** - NOT A BUG (user misinterpretation of CSV summary)
2. **Debt Calculations** - NOT A BUG (all calculations mathematically correct)
3. **PUC Machine Purchase** - WASTEFUL GA DECISION (optimization issue, not simulation bug)

## Issue #1: Workforce Counting (7 experts from 2 rookies hired)

### User Observation
> "7 experts exist but only hired 2 rookies"

### Investigation

**CSV Data Examined:**
```
Header Summary: "HIRE_ROOKIE: 2 action(s)"

Day 69: "Hire 3 rookie(s)" - Action executed
Day 69-82: 1 expert, 3 rookies, 3 in training
Day 83: 4 experts, 0 rookies, 0 in training (rookies promoted)

Day 285: "Hire 3 rookie(s)" - Action executed
Day 285-298: 4 experts, 3 rookies, 3 in training
Day 299: 7 experts, 0 rookies, 0 in training (rookies promoted)

Final State (Day 415): 7 experts, 0 rookies
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The user interpreted "HIRE_ROOKIE: 2 action(s)" as "2 rookies hired total", but this actually means **2 hiring actions were executed**, each hiring **3 rookies**.

**Verification:**
- Starting workforce: 1 expert (from INITIAL_STATE in constants.ts:86)
- First hiring action (Day 69): +3 rookies
- Rookies promoted after 15 days training (Day 83-84): 1 + 3 = **4 experts**
- Second hiring action (Day 285): +3 rookies
- Rookies promoted after 15 days training (Day 299-300): 4 + 3 = **7 experts**
- Final state: **7 experts** ✓

**Mathematical Proof:**
```
Starting experts: 1
Hiring action #1: Hire 3 rookies → After training: 1 + 3 = 4 experts
Hiring action #2: Hire 3 rookies → After training: 4 + 3 = 7 experts
Final workforce: 7 experts ✓
```

### Conclusion
**Status**: NOT A BUG - User misinterpretation of CSV summary
**Action Required**: None - Simulation logic is correct
**Recommendation**: Consider clarifying CSV header to show "2 hiring actions (6 rookies total)"

## Issue #2: Debt Calculation Accuracy

### User Observation
> "Debt calculations slightly off"

### Investigation

**Test Case: Day 241 Loan Transaction**

**CSV Data:**
```
Day 240: Cash=$1,104,734.64, Debt=$84,639.44
Day 241: Cash=$1,132,158.93, Debt=$99,303.64, Action="Take loan of $14565"
         InterestPaid=$99.20, InterestEarned=$565.80
Day 242: Cash=$1,145,316.00, Debt=$99,402.94
```

**Simulation Order of Operations** (from simulationEngine.ts):
1. Step 1: Execute actions (TAKE_LOAN)
2. Step 5: Apply debt interest
3. Step 13: Apply cash interest

**Detailed Calculation Trace:**

**Step 1: Execute TAKE_LOAN action**
```
Loan amount: $14,565
Commission rate: 2% (NORMAL_DEBT_COMMISSION)
Commission: $14,565 × 0.02 = $291.30
Net cash received: $14,565 - $291.30 = $14,273.70

Cash after loan: $1,104,734.64 + $14,273.70 = $1,119,008.34
Debt after loan: $84,639.44 + $14,565 = $99,204.44
```

**Step 2: Apply debt interest**
```
Interest rate: 0.001 (0.1% daily from DEBT_INTEREST_RATE_DAILY)
Interest charged: $99,204.44 × 0.001 = $99.20 ✓ (matches CSV)

Cash after interest paid: $1,119,008.34 - $99.20 = $1,118,909.14
Debt after interest: $99,204.44 + $99.20 = $99,303.64 ✓ (matches CSV)
```

**Step 3: Other operations** (production, sales, expenses)
```
Cash before final interest: $1,132,158.93 - $565.80 = $1,131,593.13
```

**Step 4: Apply cash interest**
```
Interest rate: 0.0005 (0.05% daily from CASH_INTEREST_RATE_DAILY)
Interest earned: $1,131,593.13 × 0.0005 = $565.80 ✓ (matches CSV)

Final cash: $1,131,593.13 + $565.80 = $1,132,158.93 ✓ (matches CSV)
```

**Verification Summary:**
- ✓ Debt change: $84,639.44 → $99,303.64 (increase of $14,664.20 = loan $14,565 + interest $99.20)
- ✓ Interest paid: $99.20 (on debt balance INCLUDING new loan)
- ✓ Cash interest: $565.80 (on end-of-day cash balance)
- ✓ Commission handling: Deducted from cash received (not added to debt)

### Conclusion
**Status**: NOT A BUG - All calculations are mathematically correct
**Action Required**: None - Finance module logic is perfect
**Implementation**: financeModule.ts:85-104 (takeLoan function)

## Issue #3: PUC Machine Purchase for Non-Functioning Custom Line

### User Observation
> "PUC machine purchased for non-functioning Custom line"

### Investigation

**CSV Data:**
```
Day 460: CustomProduction=0, CustomWIP=360 (max), PUCCount=1
Day 461: CustomProduction=0, CustomWIP=360, PUCCount=2, Action="Buy 1 PUC machine(s)"
Day 462-500: CustomProduction=0, CustomWIP=360, PUCCount=2
```

**Context:**

This CSV was generated on **Oct 3, 2025 16:49** - BEFORE the ARCP proportional allocation fix (committed Oct 3, 2025 ~18:00). At that time:

1. **Custom line was 100% blocked** due to ARCP capacity monopoly bug
2. **Standard line monopolized ALL ARCP capacity**, leaving Custom with 0
3. **WIP maxed at 360 orders** - orders couldn't complete ARCP stage

**Bottleneck Analysis:**

From constants.ts Custom line capacity per machine:
```
WMA capacity: 6 orders/day per machine
PUC capacity: 6 orders/day per machine
ARCP capacity: 3 orders/day per expert
```

**With 1 machine each:**
- WMA throughput: ~3 orders/day (shared between PASS1 and PASS2)
- PUC capacity: 6 orders/day
- ARCP capacity with 7 experts and 20% allocation: 7 × 3 × 0.20 = 4.2 orders/day

**Actual bottleneck ranking:**
1. **WMA: 3 orders/day** ← Tightest constraint
2. **ARCP: 4.2 orders/day** (but was 0 due to monopoly bug)
3. **PUC: 6 orders/day** ← Excess capacity

**Wasteful Purchase Analysis:**

Buying a second PUC machine increases capacity from 6 → 12 orders/day, but:
- WMA bottleneck limits throughput to 3 orders/day
- Extra PUC capacity (9 orders/day) sits idle
- Machine cost: $12,000 (from MACHINES.PUC.buyPrice)
- **Return on investment: $0** (doesn't increase production)

### Root Cause

**This is a Genetic Algorithm optimization issue, NOT a simulation bug.**

The GA selected a strategy that purchases a PUC machine even though:
1. Custom line wasn't producing (ARCP monopoly bug blocked it)
2. PUC wasn't the bottleneck (WMA was tighter)
3. Purchase provided zero production increase

**Possible GA Issues:**
1. Fitness function doesn't penalize wasteful machine purchases
2. GA lacks visibility into bottleneck locations
3. GA evaluates strategies without understanding pipeline constraints
4. Strategy may have been generated early in evolution before fitness feedback

### Impact of ARCP Fix

**Post-fix scenario** (with proportional ARCP allocation):
- Custom line NOW produces (ARCP monopoly resolved)
- WMA remains the bottleneck at 3 orders/day
- PUC purchase STILL wasteful (excess capacity unused)

The ARCP fix allows Custom production, but doesn't change the fact that purchasing a second PUC is inefficient when WMA is the constraint.

### Conclusion
**Status**: WASTEFUL GA DECISION - Optimization issue, not simulation bug
**Action Required**: Consider improving GA fitness function to penalize inefficient machine purchases
**Recommendation**:
- Add bottleneck detection to strategy evaluation
- Penalize purchases that don't increase throughput
- Prioritize WMA machine purchases over PUC for Custom line optimization
