- **Features**:
  - Dropdown selector for choosing data sources
  - Three data source types:
    1. **📊 Historical Data** - Real Excel baseline (default)
    2. **🔬 Latest Simulation** - Most recent run
    3. **💾 Saved Simulations** - Portfolio of saved results
  - Visual badges with color coding:
    - Historical: Amber
    - Current: Blue
    - Saved: Purple
  - Displays metadata: Net Worth, Timestamp, Strategy Name
  - Delete functionality for saved simulations
  - Empty state handling

### 3. **Updated Process Map Integration** ✅
- **File**: `src/client/components/simulation/ProcessMap.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Integrated ProcessMapSelector component
  - State management for selected data source
  - Auto-selection of new simulation results
  - Dynamic header text based on data source
  - Removed old fallback chain logic
  - Added useEffect for automatic result switching

### 4. **Data Accuracy Validation** ✅
- **Verification Script**: `scripts/validate-historical-data.js`
- **Validated Metrics**:
  - WIP calculations match Excel exactly
  - Production outputs correct
  - Financial data accurate
  - Workforce counts correct
  - Machine counts accurate

## 📊 Historical Data Accuracy Report

| Custom Queue 2 First Pass | 12 | Included | ✅ |
| Custom Queue 3 | 12 | Included | ✅ |
| Custom Queue 2 Second Pass | 12 | Included | ✅ |
| **Custom WIP Total** | **300** | **300** | ✅ |
| | | | |
| Total Days | 50 (Day 0-49) | 50 | ✅ |
| Experts | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| Rookies | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
| MCE Machines | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| WMA Machines | 2 | 2 | ✅ |
| PUC Machines | 2 | 2 | ✅ |

### Key Bottlenecks Identified in Historical Data:

1. **🚨 ARCP Critical Bottleneck** (Queue 3):
   - 414 units waiting for manual processing
   - Only 1 expert = 3 units/day capacity
   - Severe workforce shortage

2. **🚨 MCE Custom Line Bottleneck** (Queue 1):
   - 264 orders waiting for MCE processing
   - Indicates capacity allocation issues

## 🚀 How to Use

### Default View (Historical Data):
1. Open the application
2. Navigate to Process Map tab
3. **Historical Excel data displays by default** 📊
4. Shows accurate 50-day baseline from Excel file

### Switching Data Sources:
1. Click the data source selector at top of Process Map
2. Choose from dropdown:
   - 📊 Historical Data (Excel Baseline)
   - 🔬 Latest Simulation (if available)
   - 💾 Saved Simulations (portfolio)
3. View updates automatically with selected data

### Running New Simulations:
1. Run a simulation from the optimizer
2. Process Map **automatically switches** to show latest result
3. Original result is auto-saved to portfolio
4. Can switch back to historical or any saved result anytime

### Managing Portfolio:
1. Open data source selector
2. View all saved simulations with metadata
3. Click "Delete" to remove unwanted results
4. Compare different strategies by switching between them

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. ✏️ `src/client/utils/historicalDataLoader.ts` - Load real Excel data
2. ✨ `src/client/components/simulation/ProcessMapSelector.tsx` - NEW selector component
3. ✏️ `src/client/components/simulation/ProcessMap.tsx` - Integration & state management
4. ✨ `scripts/validate-historical-data.js` - NEW validation script

### Data Flow:
```
Excel File (SP25 3370-01_MedicaInitialHistoricData.xlsx)
  ↓ (converted via scripts/convert-historical-data.js)
src/client/data/historicalData.json
  ↓ (loaded by historicalDataLoader.ts)
Process Map Display (ACCURATE)
  ↓ (user interaction)
Portfolio Selector (switch between data sources)
```

### Quality Checks:
- ✅ ESLint: All files pass linting
- ✅ TypeScript: All files compile without errors
- ✅ Build: Production build successful
- ✅ Data Validation: Excel data matches Process Map exactly
- ✅ Server: Running on http://localhost:3001

## 🎉 Success Criteria Met

✅ Process Map defaults to accurate historical Excel data
✅ Can switch between historical and any simulation result
✅ Portfolio selector shows all available process maps
✅ All WIP values match source data exactly
✅ Bottleneck analysis accurate for both data types
✅ Clear visual distinction between historical vs simulation data
✅ All code passes linting and type checking
✅ Production build successful
✅ Server running and ready for testing

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add comparison view (side-by-side process maps)
2. Export process map visualizations as images
3. Add filtering/sorting for saved simulations
4. Implement process map sharing functionality
5. Add custom notes/tags to saved simulations
