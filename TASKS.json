This contradicts competitive market dynamics.\n\n**Business Case Evidence (Page 2):**\n- \"The market for standard products was dominated by purchasing departments of large health institutions, and it was very competitive\"\n- \"Executives... had kept prices below the market average\"\n- In competitive markets, pricing above market = near-zero sales\n\n**Solution:** Implement steeper demand curve:\n- Intercept: 1500 (up from 500)\n- Slope: -5.0 (down from -0.25)\n- Formula: Q = 1500 - 5.0 * P\n\n**Results with new curve:**\n- $200 (below market): 500 units/day (high demand)\n- $250 (near market): 250 units/day (moderate)\n- $300+ (above market): 0 units/day (competitive rejection)\n- $800: 0 units/day\n- $1200: 0 units/day\n\n**Files to modify:**\n- src/simulation/constants.ts (lines 185-186)\n- Update standardDemandIntercept and standardDemandSlope\n- Add comment explaining competitive market dynamics\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n- Pricing significantly above $300 results in near-zero demand\n- Previous optimizer results ($1200 price) would now fail\n- Realistic competitive behavior enforced\n- Students learn operations management, not price gouging",
